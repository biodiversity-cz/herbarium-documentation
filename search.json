    "text": "Only data directly generated by digitalization of herbarium specimens are allowed to be deposited in the HERBIO. Any data that does not fall within this category will be removed without warning and will result in a permanent ban of the user from making further deposition in the HERBIO. In the case of illegal material, the relevant authorities will be notified.\nA record is defined as the set of deposited image file and deposited metadata. Although the record can be in various states, this does not change the which rules apply to them, with the exception that the License is not applied until the record is published.\nDepositors agrees that HERBIO can distribute the users’ records under the CC-BY 4.0 Attribution, i.e., the user agrees to place their work in the public domain.\nEvery person involved with the record is responsible for the record being correct (defined is not-fraudulent and containing non-allowed data), this extent to the HERBIO members. The principal contact and depositor as well as HERBIO members are obliged to keep their contact information updated in case doubt arises. Failure of correctness or contact information can in worst case lead to deletion of the record and permanent banning from making depositions. In the case of HERBIO members termination of any rights they may have within the HERBIO and permanent banning from participating in any form.\nEvery person involved in generation and deposition of the data must agree on being associated with the record and agree that the data can be placed in the public domain.\nUsers have the right to request deletion of their record. However, as the data is in the public domain, this in practice only means that HERBIO will seize to distribute the data. HERBIO has no rights too interfere with data downloaded prior to deletion, including redistribution. Furthermore, minimal metadata cannot be deleted. A note that the user requested deletion of the record will be present on the record landing page.\nUsers are only allowed to deposit work they have been directly involved with the herbarium they are delegated to work on.\nSanctions for fraudulent behaviour include:\n\nForced alteration of record.\nDeletion of record with the note that it was deleted due to fraudulence.\nPermanent banning of one or all of the depositors from depositing within the HERBIO.\nHERBIO will attempt to notify all users of the data of it’s fraudulence, including Journal publishers.\nHERBIO will notify the relevant legal authorities, including the employers of one or all of the depositors.\n\nHERBIO are allowed to change the records by following the procedures set out by the steering committee.",

A list of supported clients and instructions can be found in the CESNET Object Storage S3 documentation, for Linux users might be CrossFTP an option.\nOnce all settled, upload your image files to the provided S3 bucket. The upload can run overnight or in the background if needed; you will find your optimal frequency and strategy to fit your digitization process.\nAfter the upload is complete, you will interact with the web interface of the repository and provide a few additional metadata fields that apply to all images in the batch (all uploaded files are taken as a single batch). Once this step is completed and you confirm import, the images will begin processing. During processing, files are removed from your S3 storage and transferred to our internal system, checked and stored.",

The exact pattern for your institution will be arranged individually.\nIf no barcode is found in the image, a filenameFallback option can be enabled. In this case, the system will derive the specimen identifier from the filename, according to a pre-agreed pattern tailored for your use as above.\nMultiple Barcodes (Multiplier): If multiple barcodes are detected in a single image, the system throw an error. In case you will use multiplier for a batch, it will i) require to be more than one valid barcode present (to make the process more predictable) and ii) duplicate the image for each corresponding ID rather than reporting an error and requiring manual ID input.",
