This repository is based on linked-data approach. Data about specimen (taxon, locality, collector etc.) are not stored in, but comes from external authority [JACQ](https://jacq.org). These linked data are harvested regularly to allow us serve a complete information about the photos stored, nevertheless this distributed architecture can lead to a time delay of dataflow. To be sure about up-to-date information about the specimen itself, please follow the related resource metadata of individual photos.

All relevant metadata are provided via OAI-PMH protocol to the [National Metadata Directory](https://nma.eosc.cz/) (NMA).
